It‚Äôs one of my favourite podcasts and so when Steven Bartlett‚Äôs book came out this week, naturally I had to buy it and read it. Steven Bartlett shared his four pillars of greatness: the self, the story, the philosophy, and the team; of which each pillar consists of multiple laws.My original plan for this newsletter was to write about few of my favourite laws from the book but I realised this could be overwhelming and it would take away the spotlight for each law; and so I am just going to focus on one law and spread them out over the next few newsletter.üß† Law 1: Fill your five buckets in the right orderDo you want to possess the power to do / build great things?Well, there are five buckets you need to fill:Knowledge SkillsNetworkResourcesReputationThe sum of your five buckets will determine your ability to do / build great things; these five buckets will determine to what extent can you change the world and move it towards your vision. These five buckets are connected and filling one helps fill another; generally speaking, they are filled in the order listed above, from knowledge to skills to network to resources to reputation.Focus on the first two buckets of knowledge and skills and the rest should handle themselves. Knowledge and skills are the foundation of which you build your life and career and it‚Äôs truly yours to own; you can lose your network, resources, and reputation but you will never lose your knowledge and skills.Never try to skip the first two buckets. If you try to jump straight to network, resources, and / or reputation bucket, you might ‚Äúsucceed‚Äù in the short-run but in the long run, your lack of knowledge and skill will catch on to you.There is no skipping the first two buckets of knowledge and skills if you‚Äôre playing long-term sustainable results. Any attempt to do so is equivalent to building your house on sand.üí• Key takeawayFocus on using your knowledge and skills to create lots of values in the world and the world will reward you with growing network (people will come to you), resources (people will pay for your services), and reputation (people will know what you are capable of).‚õ∞ 4-4-4 Exploration ProjectEach month, I would explore one new thing; a skill, a subject, or an experience.January 2023: Writing and Storytelling (Subject) ‚úÖFebruary 2023: KURIOS ‚Äì Cabinet of Curiosities (Cirque Du Soleil ‚Äî Experience) ‚úÖMarch 2023: 28 Days of Cold Exposure (Subject and Experience) ‚úÖApril 2023: Complete Growth / Product Marketing Course (Subject) üü•May 2023: LL project (Skill + Subject) ‚úÖJune 2023: LL project 2 (Skill + Subject) ‚úÖJuly 2023: LL project 3 (Skill + Subject) ‚úÖAugust 2023: LL project 4 (Skill + Subject) ‚úÖSeptember 2023: LL project 5 (Skill + Subject) üüßüìö This week, I finished reading‚Ä¶Have interesting gems you want to share with me and others?

These are your non-negotiables that are usually very closely related to your core needs and dreams.In the outer circle, list all the aspects of an issue that you are able to compromise on IF you are able to have what‚Äôs in your inner circle.Now, talk to your partners about your inner and outer circle. Ask each other:Why are the things in your inner circle so important to you?How can I support your core needs here?Tell me more about your areas of flexibility. What does it look like to be flexible?Compare both your ‚Äúbagel‚Äù of needsWhat do we agree on?What feelings do we have in common?What shared goals do we have?How might we accomplish these goals together?Finalise the compromise (even if it‚Äôs a temporary one that needs to be reevaluate later)Fill in the sentence ‚Üí A compromise that honors both our needs and dreams is‚Ä¶Flexibility is key when you can manage it. If all you do is say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to your partner, then it can make it difficult for your partner to feel safe and want to collaborate with you. Remember, compromise isn‚Äôt about perfection.

Why?You want to stop drinking alcohol... Why?Behind every goal is someone (an identity) you want to become. Figure out that identity and new goals will become clearer, more personal, and more fun üî•‚ùå You want to stop drinking because it‚Äôs healthy ‚Üí generic‚úÖ You want to stop drinking because you want to live longer and keep up with your kids ‚Üí You want to be a good husband and a fatherConsistency ‚Äî you know your why and who but you struggle to get started / keep it upThere are many micro reasons why people struggle to stick to their goals but here are three macro reasons why people fail to stay consistent:1. You are overwhelmed and uncomfortableSetting new year goals can be overwhelming and challenging. New things can feel unnatural‚Ä¶ uncomfortable‚Ä¶ and uncertain, all of which pushes us to quit.Here‚Äôs what I know ‚Üí it‚Äôs hard to get started but once you have create momentum, it‚Äôs easy to keep going.But sadly, most people never got pass the initial starting phase.2. You are not setting goals properlyThere are three types of goals: Outcome, output, and input.Most people make two mistakes when setting goals: 1) they only set outcome / output goals and ignore the input goals, and 2) they set far away goals. For example, you might have the goal of reading 100 books in 2024.Reading 100 books is an outcome / output goal and the goal‚Äôs end date is 31st December 2024. Most people stop here.Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a good start but the problem is a) you don‚Äôt know what you need to do to read 100 books, which brings me to b) you don‚Äôt know if you are on track to hit the goal, and c) it‚Äôs hard to create momentum since you only win once you hit the goal by the end of the year.In addition to outcome and output goals, you need to set checkpoints and input goals.3. You don‚Äôt have a daily action and value systemOnce you have set up the different types of goals, systems are important to help us stick to the action plan and make better decisions in day-to-day moments. Most of these systems can be learn through books, podcasts, newsletters, and others but the best system is through your own personal experience of testing and figure out what works best for you. I will share some action and value systems below that I have gathered over the years.‚úÖ 2 things you can do to make 2024 your best yearIdentity ‚Äî figure out the identity you want to become and its valuesThe best way I have found to do this is to find people that you admire or people that‚Äôs currently living the life you want to live and ask yourself what makes you attracted to them? What values do you admire of them?Study them deeply and create a list of values that resonate with you. Through that list of values, you should be able to figure out the identity you want to become.Abstract identity ‚Üí Concrete daily actions and valuesIdentities are usually abstract‚Ä¶ I want to be an adventurous person‚Ä¶ Great.I want to be a lifelong learner... Great.I want to be a good partner‚Ä¶ Great.The question is what does the day-to-day concrete actions for these identities look like?Here‚Äôs how I do it. FYI, I don‚Äôt set yearly goals, instead I focus on one quarter at a time; every quarter I will review everything and reset.1. List out all the areas in life that matter to you2. For each area in life, list out 1 - 3 OUTCOME / OUTPUT goals that align with your identity3. For each outcome / output goal, set 2 things: a) checkpoints and b) input goals4. Organise all your input goals into weekly, monthly, and quarterly.5. Take out your calendar and map out all the daily and weekly input goals6. Monitor your checkpoints at the end of each week to see if you are on track or not. If not, what changes should you make next week to get back on track.7. Repeat 1 - 6Here‚Äôs one of my goals for Q1 2024:Area: Character BuildingOne of the outcome / output goals: Read 15 non-fiction booksCheckpoint(s): Read around 1 - 2 non-fiction books per weekInput goal(s): Read an hour per dayCalendar view: I read 5:30am - 6:30am everyday. If this doesn‚Äôt happen, I will shift the reading block to another time in the dayWeekly reflection: How many books have I read this week? Any changes for next week?Enjoy this week‚Äôs newsletter?
